# Lab 1
This lab goes over how to create a custom module in go and import for future applications

It requires to perform the 

    go mod init <Current_Directory_Name>

from the directory that you wish to store all of your functions in.

The code in *myadder/* is a simple add function that adds two variables and a test file to test the function.
In *main.go*, you can see how to import the custom function.
(This is assuming that the mod init happened in this repo's source directory)
