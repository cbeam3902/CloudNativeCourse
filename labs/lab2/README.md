# Lab 2
This lab uses the interface{} type and how it can be used to represent any data type. This lab also introduces how to attach functions to data types.

This lab was designed before generics were a thing in GO.

This lab implements a LRU cache using a map and a queue to track the most recently used item.

To run the code, use `go test` to execute the test cases.
