# Lab 8
This lab introduces interacting with a database program such as MangoDB. The goal of this lab is to containerize lab 4 and have it use MangoDB as it's database handler instead of how it was before.

This lab is also assuming that you'll be using Docker compose to set up the containers because of how the IP of the database changes if you try to do it separately.

There's a test script that will act as an example that uses all of the different functions that the webserver can do.
