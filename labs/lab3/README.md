# Lab 3
This lab introduces GO channels.

GO channels allow data to be interchanged between threads via chan type variables. This allows a form of communication between the threads.

To run the code, in a terminal run `go run chat.go`. To make a chat client, open another terminal and run `netcat localhost 8000`. You can make as many chat clients as you wish.
